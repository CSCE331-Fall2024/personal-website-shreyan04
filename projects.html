            <p>ScamFinder is a robust machine learning project where I designed and implemented a TensorFlow-based model to identify suspicious URLs. The model utilizes advanced feature extraction techniques to analyze various URL attributes, enabling it to effectively flag potential scams. I collected and preprocessed a diverse dataset through web scraping, which was crucial for training and validating the model. Rigorous testing on this dataset resulted in a high accuracy rate of 98%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness and reliability. This project not only showcases my skills in machine learning and data science but also highlights my capability to tackle cybersecurity challenges through innovative solutions.</p>

            <p>Engineered an advanced AI model using PyTorch to filter background noise from voice recordings, significantly enhancing audio clarity and making spoken content more intelligible. This model leverages sophisticated deep learning techniques to distinguish between speech and noise, ensuring that the final audio output is clean and focused. Additionally, I integrated a transcription feature that converts spoken text into accessible text files on users' computers. This functionality facilitates easy access to written records of spoken content, further improving the usability and accessibility of the audio recordings. This project highlights my expertise in machine learning and audio signal processing, as well as my ability to deliver practical solutions for enhancing user experience.</p>

            <p>Launched a Connect4 game utilizing Python's Tkinter library to create an engaging and user-friendly graphical interface. The project involved designing an intuitive layout that facilitates seamless gameplay and enhances user interaction. I focused on optimizing the user interface to improve performance, which involved reducing lag and ensuring smooth animations throughout the game. By refining the graphical elements and game logic, I was able to deliver a responsive and enjoyable gaming experience. This project demonstrates my ability to develop interactive applications and my skills in performance optimization and graphical design using Python.</p>

            <p>Formulated an innovative Python-based sensor system designed to assist para-cyclists with limited sensory abilities, aiming to enhance their cycling experience and safety. This project involved developing a custom sensor system that provides real-time feedback and support tailored to the specific needs of athletes with sensory impairments. To ensure the system's effectiveness and relevance, I conducted extensive data collection from elite para-athletes, which was used to refine and customize the prototype. The iterative process of gathering and analyzing feedback allowed me to create a solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by para-cyclists, demonstrating my commitment to inclusive technology and my ability to apply data-driven insights to real-world problems.</p>
