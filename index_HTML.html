            <p>I'm a passionate rising Software Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a keen interest in solving complex problems through innovative software solutions. Throughout my career and education, I’ve worked on diverse projects ranging from mobile apps to large-scale web applications. I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can contribute to team success while continuing to learn and grow. Beyond coding, I am a semi professional cricketer and compete on a national level in the Minor League Cricket Championship. I also enjoy tackling new topics and over the last few months it has been day trading, a skill I hope to develop in the near future.</p>
